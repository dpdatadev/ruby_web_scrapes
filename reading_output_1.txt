2 Corinthians 11:1-6				  (Epistle)
Oh, that you would bear with me in a little folly – and indeed you do bear with me.For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted – you may well put up with it!For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles.Even though I am untrained in speech, yet I am not in knowledge. But we have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things.
