2 Thessalonians 2:13-3:5				  (Epistle)
But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth,to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle.Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting consolation and good hope by grace,comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
