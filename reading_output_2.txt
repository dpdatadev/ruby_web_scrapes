Luke 10:19-21				  (Gospel)
Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.
