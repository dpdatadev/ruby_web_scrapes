Luke 20:9-18				  (Gospel)
Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Probably they will respect him when they see him.’But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they heard it they said, “Certainly not!”Then He looked at them and said, “What then is this that is written: ‘The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone’? Whoever falls on that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.”
