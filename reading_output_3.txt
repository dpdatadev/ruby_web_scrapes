Luke 12:16-21				  (Gospel)
Then He spoke a parable to them, saying: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.And he thought within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, since I have no room to store my crops?’So he said, ‘I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there I will store all my crops and my goods.‘And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.”’But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?’So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”
