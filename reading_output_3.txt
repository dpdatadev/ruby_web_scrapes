1 Thessalonians 5:9-13, 24-28				  (Epistle)
For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,and to esteem them very highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.Brethren, pray for us.Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
